# Backlog — MS Operations Hub

## Ready to build (unblocked)
- [ ] Leads close-rate numerator: pull Customer-status leads from /leads/data using the exact
      advanced-search request params (per the conversion probe). Lights up conversions + per-rep.
- [ ] Cancelled – This Year (by deactivation date) + cancelled-by-reason — needs the per-customer
      deactivation scrape job (date+reason are scrape-only; sales_status scrapeable from
      service-information). See REFERENCE §9 #6.
- [ ] Assigned-only "Next scheduled" + 48h color rescue: per-customer scheduled-services scrape,
      Route Assigned == "Assigned" (exact match), wire into rowToneClass() hook. See REFERENCE §9 #5.

## Needs a human decision
- [ ] "Real lead" definition for close rate — pending Rivka & Leon (drops into isRealLead() hook).

## Worklist / cleanup (not code)
- [ ] 4 customers-with-issues to review: Alex Abraham (1305276), Ariel Roffel (1237341),
      Yuliya Lankri (1164303), Zachariah Robinson (1237274).

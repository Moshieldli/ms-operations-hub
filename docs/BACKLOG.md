# Backlog — MS Operations Hub

## Ready to build (unblocked)
- [ ] Cancelled – This Year (by deactivation date) + cancelled-by-reason — needs the per-customer
      deactivation scrape job (date+reason are scrape-only; sales_status scrapeable from
      service-information). See REFERENCE §9 #6.
- [ ] Assigned-only "Next scheduled" + 48h color rescue: per-customer scheduled-services scrape,
      Route Assigned == "Assigned" (exact match), wire into rowToneClass() hook. See REFERENCE §9 #5.
- [ ] Top converting lead sources — rank marketing source/type by conversion (which sources turn
      into customers, not just volume). Note: lead-side marketing_type is ~93% blank, so source the
      marketing type from the converted customer's record; join via the 76 converted leads from the
      Advanced Search feed. Self-probe the customer-side marketing field first.

## Needs a human decision
- [ ] "Real lead" definition for close rate — pending Rivka & Leon (drops into isRealLead() hook).

## Worklist / cleanup (not code)
- [ ] 4 customers-with-issues to review: Alex Abraham (1305276), Ariel Roffel (1237341),
      Yuliya Lankri (1164303), Zachariah Robinson (1237274).

## Done (recent)
- [x] /texting archive tab — Aerialink SMS history in a Neon-backed inbox (texting_messages +
      texting_contacts, imported via import-texting.mjs); left-pane list + threaded view. Gated by
      the app's only auth (TEXTING_PASSWORD + texting_auth cookie via src/middleware.ts). See §5.7.
- [x] Texting search made server-authoritative: /api/texting/search?find= queries the DB by
      phone/name so a full-number search always finds its conversation (not just the in-memory list).
- [x] Nav: Texting tab added to the top nav.
- [x] PhoneBurner: hourly roster-reconciliation conversion sweep (/api/cron/conversion-sweep,
      §5.5b) replaces the old conversionCleanup; */15 route is now notes-refresh only.
- [x] 2026-Renewed bucket fix (RETAINED ~991 / AT_RISK ~17)
- [x] Year-relative cancelled taxonomy + Not Renewed (377) + issues list
- [x] Sales relabel/reorg + inline definitions + reconciliation line
- [x] Overdue Profile link + day-based coloring + new-tab links
- [x] Visual polish pass (type scale + semantic color)
- [x] Leads tab scaffold (denominator + per-rep live; numerator pending)
- [x] Leads close-rate numerator + denominator via the Advanced Search two-step feed
      (set search[leadStatus][] for all five statuses, pull /lead/lead-advanced-search/data).
      Conversions live: 76 / 324 = 23.5% YTD; per-rep + unattributed from the one feed.
- [x] CLAUDE.md + REFERENCE.md consolidation
